## iOS 101: Lab - Unit 2 - Mario Kart Pt. 2 (Optionals & Control Flow)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this lab I was able to...

1. Understand and work with Optionals in Swift
2. Use `if let` and `guard let` to safely unwrap optionals
3. Use `?` and `!` to interact with optionals
4. Use `guard` statements for early exits
5. Perform optional and forced type casting

### ðŸš€ Features

#### âœ… Required Features

1. Print a message when an optional has a non-nil value
2. Use the powerup on Mario
3. Decipher the mystery box and apply the correct effect
4. Show the correct number of karts based on the applied setting
5. Set the correct kart size based on the applied setting
6. Set the correct kart speed based on the applied setting

### ðŸ›  Notes

- I only edited code in the sections marked by comments.
- This lab helped reinforce how Swift handles optional values and how to work with them safely and effectively.
